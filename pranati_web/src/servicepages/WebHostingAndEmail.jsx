          Business owners interested in online marketing and website development
          should familiarize themselves with the many different web hosting
          tiers available. Shared hosting, virtual private server (VPS) hosting,
          dedicated hosting, and WordPress hosting plans are all available.
        </p>
        <h4>Shared Web Hosting</h4>
        <p>
          Shared hosting is web hosting in which multiple websites share the
          same server. For example, Site A shares the same server with sites B
          and C. The upside is that multiple sites can save on server costs, so
          shared web hosting tends to be very inexpensive. You can find an
          option for less than per month.
        </p>
        <h4>VPS Web Hosting</h4>
        <p>
          VPS (virtual private server) hosting provides more flexibility than
          shared hosting. While it’s true that multiple sites may share the same
          server, each site’s traffic surge will have a less dramatic effect on
          other sites. That said, VPS hosting costs more than shared hosting.
        </p>
        <h4>Dedicated Web hosting</h4>
        <p>
          On the other hand, dedicated hosting, which provides more server
          resources than shared hosting, is more expensive. It’s ideal for sites
          that demand an incredible amount of server resources.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Cloud Hosting?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud hosting works by splitting a physical server into multiple
          virtual servers called cloud servers. These virtual servers connect to
          create a single network for hosting websites. It is also called
          cluster server hosting because of its interconnected cloud structure.
